Interactive Lisp Book (Snippets):

9.3 (d) Enter (quote 5e2), ’5e2, and 5e2.
==============================================================================
Note that the value of quote is not the S-expression you type for the argument
as you type it, but the Lisp object represented by that S-expression and it
is typed back to you in Common Lisp’s choice of printed representation.
